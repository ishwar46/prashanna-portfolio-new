## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Single-page layout chosen for simpler UX / fewer clicks to CTA
- Next.js Server Actions (useActionState) for contact form — verify against Next.js 16.1.6 docs before Phase 3 implementation
- Resend for email delivery — requires domain verification before Phase 3 testing (DNS/account task, not code)
- Motion 12.36 for animations — validate `motion/react` import path at start of Phase 2
- [Phase 01-01]: Navy/gold oklch palette: hue 250 for navy, 65-85 for gold; semantic tokens remapped (primary=navy-900, accent=gold-500, secondary=light navy tint)
- [Phase 01-01]: Brand colors in separate @theme block (not @theme inline) per Tailwind v4 docs for standalone utility class generation
- [Phase 01-02]: Used base-ui render prop instead of asChild for polymorphic Button-as-anchor components
- [Phase 01-03]: Lucide Home icon for Equal Housing Lender indicator (no external image asset)
- [Phase 01-03]: Footer Quick Links subset: Services, About, Calculator, Contact (not full nav)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 3] Resend sending domain must be verified in the Resend dashboard before contact form testing
- [Pre-Phase 2] Confirm real testimonial content with Prashanna; if unavailable, TestimonialsSection should be deferred
- [Pre-Phase 4] Prashanna to confirm licensed states/areas for geographic SEO copy in structured data
